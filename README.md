# book-search-engine

This project consisted of taking a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

User is able to search for books and save them in the database. User has to be logged-in/signed-up to the application in order to save the books.
